## Instructions

Open or create a `designs.js` file and start building out the app's functionality.

While completing this project keep the following in mind:

1. Define your variables by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. This is where your jQuery skills can come into play! For instance, the submit button, the table, and the color picker need to be accessed. The value of the color selected needs to be stored as well, since the clicked cell in the table needs to be set to the selected color.

2. Add event listeners to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be dynamically set by the user.

3.Set the size of the cross stitch canvas as an N by M grid with the makeGrid() function. Use your knowledge of JavaScript loops to dynamically clear and create the table based on user input. Each cell should have an event listener that sets the background color of the cell to the selected color.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Criteria and Specifications
Design

1. JavaScript Loops and Functions
   - The student implements while and for loops to clear and create the grid dynamically.
   - Student successfully implements makeGrid() and call it upon the user submitting the grid size.

2. JavaScript Selectors and Event Listeners
   - The student uses selectors to access user input values and select elements in the DOM.
   - The student uses event listeners to trigger grid creation, and modify the grid colors.
   
Code Quality

- Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.
- JavaScript code follows Udacity's styleguide. (https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html)
